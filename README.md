## Description

Elves & Orcs is a digital remake of the Estonian social deduction game **"Kings & Spies"** (*Kuningad & Spioonid*). In this tense deduction challenge, you must identify two hidden spies among your team of characters before time runs out.

Originally a tabletop game popular in Estonia, Kings & Spies tests your ability to analyze behavior, track patterns, and make logical deductions under pressure. This digital adaptation brings the experience to life with an interactive interface and streamlined gameplay.

## Features

- **Social deduction gameplay** — Analyze mission results to uncover hidden spies
- **5-day time limit** — Race against the clock to gather enough information
- **Mission system** — Send characters on missions and observe the results
- **Note-taking tools** — Track your observations and narrow down suspects
- **AI opponent** — Play against a computer-controlled adversary
- **Responsive UI** — Clean, modern interface built with React

## How to Play

1. You have **5 in-game days** to identify **2 hidden spies** among your characters.
2. Each day, you may send **up to 3 characters** on a mission.
3. After each mission, the game log tells you **how many spies** were present on that mission.
4. Use your **observation notes** to track which characters appear suspicious.
5. On **Day 5**, you must make your final accusation — choose the 2 characters you believe are the spies.

**Correct guess = Victory. Wrong guess = The kingdom falls.**

The key is to cross-reference mission results: if a mission with 3 characters returned 0 spies, all three are safe. Use logic and deduction to narrow down the suspects!

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
